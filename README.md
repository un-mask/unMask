# unMask - The new Twitter with no ~~musk~~ mask
We are trying to create an alternative version to the restrictive social managed by Elon Musk to bring it back to its old splendor, to that social that differed from everyone here meta-social

unMask will be completely open source and guided exclusively by the community that supports 

Our principles are as follows:
- clear and transparent 💧
- free forever 🆓
- free from masks 🎭
- as safe as possible 🔒

## Testing (frontend)
To try it for now you can download client folder and run
```
npm i
npm start
```
